        answer: 2,
        explanation: "Justice <strong>H.R. Khanna's</strong> opinion was crucial. While he agreed that Parliament could amend Fundamental Rights, he crucially added the caveat that the 'basic structure or framework' of the Constitution could not be altered. This provided the logical foundation for the majority verdict."
