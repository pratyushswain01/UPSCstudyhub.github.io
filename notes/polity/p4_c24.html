                    The Indian Parliamentary Group (IPG) plays a vital role in fostering inter-parliamentary relations and enhancing India’s engagement with global legislative bodies.

It serves as a bridge between the Indian Parliament and various international parliaments, promoting goodwill and cooperation. By participating in the IPG, members can gain valuable insights into parliamentary practices and strengthen India’s voice on global platforms.

                    <p>Beyond being a diplomatic formality, the Indian Parliamentary Group (IPG) serves as Parliament's essential window to the world.</p>
                    <p>In an age where national legislatures can easily become echo chambers, the IPG ensures that global winds of change—new legislative ideas, innovative governance models, and diverse political perspectives—flow into our own corridors of power. It not only exports India's democratic ethos to global forums but, more critically, it imports a world of experience.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the IPG's true success is measured not in the handshakes it brokers, but in its ability to keep our domestic lawmaking globally conscious, self-aware, and insulated from the perils of insularity.</p>
