                <p class="mt-4">For elections to the Lok Sabha, each state is divided into territorial constituencies. The Constitution ensures that there is uniformity of representation between different states and between different constituencies in the same state. Though the system of communal representation is abandoned, it provides for the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes based on population ratios. These reserved seats are elected by all voters in the constituency, without a separate electorate, and members of SC/ST communities are not debarred from contesting general (non-reserved) seats.</p>

                    Presiding officers of Parliament, such as the Speaker/Chairman, are responsible for maintaining order, impartiality, and procedural fairness during parliamentary proceedings. They ensure debates are conducted respectfully and by established rules, while also representing the institution’s dignity and authority. On the other hand, leaders of Parliament represent their respective parties/groups in parliamentary debates, negotiate with other parties on legislative matters, and often serve as key spokespersons for their party’s policies and positions. Both presiding officers and parliamentary leaders are essential figures in the effective functioning of democratic legislative bodies.

<p class="text-base sm:text-lg bg-blue-50 p-4 md:p-6 rounded-xl border-l-4 border-blue-400 text-blue-900 shadow-sm">
    In parliamentary terminology, a whip is a written order that party members be present for an important vote, or that they vote only in a particular way. It can also refer to a designated official authorized by a party to issue a whip. The office of 'whip' is not mentioned in the Constitution or in the Rules of the House but is based on the conventions of the parliamentary government.

<div class="organ-card">
    <h5 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3"><i class="fas fa-person-booth mr-2"></i>Voting in the House</h5>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm mt-3 space-y-2 pl-4">
        <li><strong>Constitutional Basis:</strong> As per **Article 100**, all questions at any sitting of either House are decided by a majority of votes of the members present and voting.</li>
        <li><strong>Default Method (Simple Majority):</strong> This is the most common method, where a motion is passed if it is supported by more than 50% of the members who are present in the House and participate in the voting.</li>
        <li><strong>Presiding Officer's Role:</strong> To maintain impartiality, the Speaker (in Lok Sabha) or the Chairman (in Rajya Sabha) does not vote in the first instance.</li>
        <li><strong>Casting Vote:</strong> In the event of a tie (an equality of votes), the Presiding Officer exercises a **casting vote**. This is a crucial power used to resolve a deadlock and prevent the legislative process from stalling.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Majorities:</strong> For specific constitutional functions, other types of majorities are required, such as **Absolute, Effective, and Special Majorities**, which are used for more significant actions like constitutional amendments, impeachment of the President, or removal of judges.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="organ-card">
    <h5 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3"><i class="fas fa-vote-yea mr-2"></i>Methods of Voting</h5>
    <p class="text-sm">
        To ascertain the decision of the House, the Presiding Officer uses several methods, progressing from simple to more formal procedures as needed.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm mt-3 space-y-3 pl-4">
        <li>
            <strong>Voice Vote:</strong> This is the initial and quickest method where the Presiding Officer asks members to say 'Aye' (for yes) or 'No'. The decision is made based on the perceived volume. It is typically used for matters with a broad consensus.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Division:</strong> If any member challenges the outcome of a voice vote, a 'Division' is ordered to ensure an accurate count. This can be done through:
            <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-6 mt-2">
                <li><strong>Automatic Vote Recorder (AVR):</strong> The most modern method where members use electronic buttons from their seats.</li>
                <li><strong>Going into the Lobbies:</strong> A traditional method where 'Ayes' and 'Noes' physically separate into different lobbies to be counted.</li>
                <li><strong>Head Count:</strong> The Presiding Officer may ask members to simply stand in their places for a physical count.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Secret Ballot:</strong> This method ensures confidentiality and is used for specific proceedings like the elections for the President and Vice-President.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="organ-card">
    <h5 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3"><i class="fas fa-language mr-2"></i>Language in Parliament</h5>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm mt-3 space-y-2 pl-4">
        <li><strong>Constitutional Basis (Article 120):</strong> The Constitution specifies that business in Parliament shall be transacted in **Hindi or in English**.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Framework:</strong> The **Official Languages Act, 1963**, provided for the continuation of English for official purposes of the Union and in Parliament for an indefinite period, alongside Hindi.</li>
        <li><strong>Provision for Diversity:</strong> To uphold India's linguistic diversity, Article 120 also empowers the Presiding Officer of a House to permit any member who cannot adequately express themselves in Hindi or English to address the House in their **mother tongue**.</li>

<div class="organ-card">

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm mt-3 space-y-2 pl-4">
        <li><strong>Constitutional Basis (Article 88):</strong> This article grants special rights to every Minister and the Attorney General of India.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope of Rights:</strong> They have the right to **speak in** and **take part in the proceedings** of either House, any joint sitting, and any parliamentary committee of which they are a member.</li>
        <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> This provision facilitates effective coordination between the executive and the legislature, allowing ministers to represent the government in both houses and the Attorney General to provide legal counsel directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Crucial Limitation:</strong> They **shall not be entitled to vote** in a House of which they are not a member. The Attorney General, not being a member of either House, has no right to vote. This upholds the principle that only the representatives of a chamber can decide its outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="organ-card">
    <h5 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3"><i class="fas fa-user-clock mr-2"></i>Lame-Duck Session</h5>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm mt-3 space-y-2 pl-4">
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The term refers to the **final session of an existing Lok Sabha** that takes place *after* the general elections for a new Lok Sabha have been held but *before* the new House is officially constituted.</li>
        <li><strong>The "Lame-Ducks":</strong> The members of the outgoing Lok Sabha who were not re-elected in the new elections are called "lame-ducks".</li>
        <li><strong>Nature and Significance:</strong> This is not a formal constitutional term. These sessions are typically short and do not involve significant legislative business, as the popular mandate of the House has effectively expired with the election of its successor.</li>

    The Budget is an annual financial statement presented by the Government, detailing its revenue and expenditure for the upcoming fiscal year. Referred to as the ‘Annual Financial Statement’ in **Article 112** of the Constitution, it outlines fiscal policies, priorities, and allocations. Presented by the Finance Minister, it undergoes thorough scrutiny, debate, and approval by Parliament, playing a vital role in shaping the country’s economic direction.

        <p class="text-sm mt-1">The Finance Minister presents the Budget to the Lok Sabha, usually on the 1st of February. No discussion takes place on this day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="organ-card">
        <h5 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-800">2. General Discussion</h5>

    <div class="organ-card">
        <h5 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-800">3. Scrutiny by Departmental Committees</h5>
        <p class="text-sm mt-1">The Houses are adjourned for about three to four weeks. During this period, the 24 departmental standing committees examine the demands for grants in detail and submit reports.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="organ-card">
        <h5 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-800">4. Voting on Demands for Grants</h5>
        <p class="text-sm mt-1">The Lok Sabha votes on the demands for grants ministry-wise, in light of the committee reports. This is an exclusive privilege of the Lok Sabha. During this stage, members can move **Cut Motions**.</p>

<p class="text-base sm:text-lg bg-blue-50 p-4 md:p-6 rounded-xl border-l-4 border-blue-400 text-blue-900 shadow-sm">
    The concept of parliamentary sovereignty, derived from the British tradition, is a fundamental principle in India's governance structure. It defines the authority of the Indian Parliament within the constitutional framework and serves as a cornerstone of the democratic system, ensuring the primacy of elected representatives in shaping the nation’s laws and policies.

    <p class="font-bold text-gray-700">The British Concept of Sovereignty (A.V. Dicey)</p>
    <p class="text-sm mt-1">The traditional British principle implies that Parliament can make, amend, or repeal any law; it can make constitutional laws with the same procedure as ordinary laws; and its laws cannot be declared invalid by the judiciary.</p>
</div>

<p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">Unlike the British Parliament, the Indian Parliament is not a sovereign body as there are legal and constitutional restrictions on its authority. The key limiting factors are:</p>

        <p class="text-sm">The Indian Parliament must operate within the boundaries set by the written Constitution. There is a clear distinction between its legislative power (to make ordinary laws) and its constituent power (to amend the Constitution), with the latter being more rigid.</p>
        <div class="mt-3 border-t pt-3">

    The doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty in India reflects a delicate balance between legislative authority and constitutional supremacy.
