        <p><strong>Introduction of Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder:</strong> The <strong>Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2015</strong>, brought about significant changes to the provisions related to the OCI status as outlined in the Principal Act.</p>
        <ul class="styled-list mt-3 space-y-2">
            <li>This act introduced a new category known as the <strong>“Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder,”</strong> consolidating both the Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) card scheme and the OCI card scheme.</li>
            <li><strong>Consolidation of PIO and OCI Schemes:</strong> The PIO card scheme was introduced on August 19, 2002, followed by the OCI card scheme on December 2, 2005.</li>
            <li>These two schemes were in operation concurrently, which led to <strong>confusion</strong> among applicants.</li>
            <li>To address these issues, the Government of India created a single scheme that <strong>merged the positive aspects of both</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Transition from PIO to OCI Status:</strong> The PIO scheme was rescinded effective January 9, 2015; all existing PIO card holders are now considered OCI cardholders.</li>
