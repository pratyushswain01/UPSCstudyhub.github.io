                    <p class="text-lg">On the lines of UPSC in the centre, there is a State Public Service Commission (SPSC) for every state, which is an independent Constitutional body. It is basically the major recruiting agency of a state.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Evolution and Significance of State Public Service Commissions</h3>
                <ul class="icon-list">
                    <li><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i><span><strong>Constitutional Basis:</strong> Article 315 to 323 (Part XIV) deals with the composition, appointment and removal of members along with the independence, powers and functions of the SPSC.</span></li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-history"></i><span><strong>Government of India Act, 1919:</strong> proposed to set up the Federal Public Service Commission.</span></li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i><span><strong>Establishment:</strong> In 1926 on the recommendation of Lee Commission (1924), the Federal Public Service Commission was established.</span></li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i><span><strong>GoI Act, 1935:</strong> provided for the Central and State Public Service Commission.</span></li>
                </ul>

                    <li><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i><span>Watchdog of merit system in the State.</span></li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-sitemap"></i><span>SPSC is only a central recruiting agency in the state while the Department of Personnel or the General Administration Department is the central personnel agency in the state.</span></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Composition and Tenure of State Public Service Commissions</h3>
                <ul class="icon-list">
                    <li><i class="fas fa-users"></i><span>The composition of the State Public Service Commission is similar to that of the Union Public Service Commission.</span></li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i><span>The SPSC consists of a Chairman and other members who are appointed by the <strong>GOVERNOR</strong> of a state.</span></li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i><span>The Governor of a state enjoys discretionary power to determine the composition and conditions of service of the chairman and other members of SPSC.</span></li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-id-card"></i><span><strong>Qualification:</strong> According to the Constitution of India, 50% of the members of SPSC should be those who have held government office (Government of India/State Government) for at least 10 years. It mentions no other qualification.</span></li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-hourglass-half"></i><span><strong>Tenure:</strong> All the members including the Chairman hold office for a six year term, or until they attain the age of 62 years, whichever is earlier.</span></li>

                <p>The Governor can temporarily appoint one of the members of the SPSC as an acting chairman if:</p>
